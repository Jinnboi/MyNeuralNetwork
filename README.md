# Marcos' Neural Network
An implementation of a neural network using only Python and NumPy.

# Description
This Python program implements a neural network with a constructor that takes in input size, hidden layer size, and output size as arguments depending on the shape of the dataset. For my own testing, I used the MNIST Dataset and ultimately achieved ~97% accuracy.

# Contributions
This was my first dive into machine-learning (and Linear Algebra) and as a result, I may have made a mistake or overcomplicated a step of the process. If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to reach out!
